    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a delicious French pastry, known by its crescent shape.
      (Croissant means crescent in French). Puff pastry is used to make this
      delicacy - the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded a few
      times, then rolled into its shape. It is then glazed with butter and
      baked. The original croissant was called Kipfel and originated in Austria
      in 1683. It was created in honor of the Austrian victory over the Turks
      and modeled after the crescent on the Turkish flag. (Some historians say
      the croissant originated in Hungary) August Zang, an Austrian artillery
      officer, is credited with bringing the croissant to France when he opened
      his own Viennese bakery in Paris. (Some say it was Marie Antoinette who
      brought the croissant to France...) The Croissant became the French
      national product in 1920.
